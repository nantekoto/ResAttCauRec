## ðŸ”¥ Introduction
We present a new approach to integrate causality into LSTM model by pretraining hidden states, to forecast soil moisture and flash drought.
This repository contains the proposed ResAttCauRec model and ablation study. The manuscript is currently under review by *Water Resources Research*.
